# Deep Q-Learning for LunarLander-v3

This project applies deep Q-learning techniques to solve the "LunarLander-v3" environment, which was originally part of OpenAI Gym but is now hosted by Farama at [gymnasium.farama.org](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

## Overview
Deep Q-Learning has been implemented to navigate and solve the challenges presented by the LunarLander-v3 environment. The goal is to safely land the lunar module on the moon, balancing various dynamic parameters.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, then clone this repository and run the script:
```bash
python lunar_lander.py
```
